						<h2>Components</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The building blocks of a React application</li>
							<li>Corresponds (usually) to an HTML Element on a page</li>
							<li>Contains a method to render markup</li>
							<li>Must be "mounted" using ReactDOM.render() with createElement()</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Components are the building blocks of a React application. The markup to generate
							a component very closely resembles HTML, and most concepts of managing HTML through
							JavaScript extend to React Components.  A component is typically structured as a class,
							using the ES6 class syntax (example to follow).  The component class will contain a render
							method that is used to output a JSX virtual dom tree.  Going back to the virtual dom
							section from yesterday, this is what makes React fast - the fact that it keeps an in-memory
							representation of your components, that render actual HTML to the page.  All components are
							mounted to another component.  This typically occurs within the JSX when a component is rendered.
							However there is also a root component that must be rendered to the page, and this is typically
							attached to a single DOM node (a div) and the page structure proceeds to populate from there.

						<h2>Props</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Live in this.props within the scope of the component</li>
							<li>Are Read-Only within the scope of the component</li>
							<li>Are passed from the parent component to child components</li>
							<li>Act as a sort of "configuration" for components</li>
							<li>Syntax mimics that of HTML attributes</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Props act as a way to pass key/value pairs to a component.  You can use them within a
							component through a property called this.props.  Each key passed in is available as a
							property in this.props, and you use those keys to access the values assigned to your
							component's props.  The are read-only, so you cannot change the value of a prop within
							a component.  However, if there is a change in a parent component, for instance, an API
							call or some other change that triggers a re-render, those modified values could be passed
							in as props to child components, which would update those components.  The best way to
							think about them is like HTML attributes.  They are used to configure a component to either
							appear or behave in a certain way, and if you make an update to that value, the underlying
							behavior changes.  (think like a "readonly" or "disabled" attribute on an HTML input or button)

						<h2>Reserved Properties</h2>

							<li>The HTML "style" attribute is called "styles"</li>
							<li>Inline Styles are passed as an object to "styles"</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							After reading these bullet points, just note that "className" specifically is gonna
							trip people up, especially if you copy code snippets to use in a react app

						<h2>State</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Live in this.state within the scope of the component</li>
							<li>Can be updated by calling setState() within a component</li>
							<li>State updates will trigger a re-render</li>
							<li>DOM updates are applied to the component and its descendants as needed</li>
							<li>React optimizes for minimum disruption to the DOM</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Understanding state updates and how they affect a component is probably one
							of the trickiest, yet most important parts of building applications in React. The
							simplest answer, straight from the react docs, is that state changes always trigger
							a new render.  To update state for a component, you call this.setState, which takes
							two arguments - an object of the keys/values to update, and a callback that is fired
							after the state update is complete.

							React won't actually update a DOM representation of a component though,
							unless there is a change in props or state that actually affects a render.  Remember
							that the virtual dom is a representation of a components with their props and state,
							and react always manages rendering through its virtual dom.  Because of this, it's
							extremely important to understand that there may be unintended consequences when you
							mix libraries like jQuery with react.  jQuery might mutate the actual DOM, but since
							react doesn't track those mutations it will overwrite UI changes you make with jQuery.

							My best advice is to avoid using libraries like jQuery in react - if you google
							"awesome react" you'll see many components already build, a lot of which have similar
							if not identical functionality as jQuery plugins. (show search results here)
							If you must use a jQuery plugin, use it sparingly and only for things like animation
							or presentation - definitely do NOT use it for data manipulation

						<h2>Events</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Event Handlers are passed as props to a component</li>
							<li>Syntax follows the form<br><br>
								<code>on&lt;Event&gt;={ this.doThing.bind(this) }</code><br><br></li>
							<li>React creates a SyntheticEvent object</li>
							<li>Properties like event.target can be used to read from the underlying element</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Events in React can be passed as props to a component, as well as Native HTML elements
							when writing JSX.  If you write a component, you're responsible for handling an "event",
							and we'll see a sample of doing that when creating our components.  Events follow the
							naming format of their corresponding HTML attributes with onEvent, where "Event" can be
							"click" for buttons or links, "change" for input fields, "mouseover", and so on.  When
							you assign an event handler to an event property, you need to bind its "this" context to the
							component.  If you're not super-familiar with context in javascript that's ok, react
							handles a lot of that for you.  The main thing you need to remember is to either call
							"bind", passing this as the parameter, or set an anonymous function that calls your class
							method as the handler.  We'll see examples of both of those as we write our application.
							A SyntheticEvent object is created by React and passed to native HTML event handlers, which
							contain most of the properties you'd need to work with events.  For instance, you can use
							event.target.value to get the value of an input field, or event.target.files to get an
							array of files to upload.

						<h2>Children</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>this.props.children is a special prop that is analogous to innerHTML</li>
							<li>It is iterable, but you must iterate it using React.Children</li>
							<li>Elements between the start &amp; close tags of a JSX element are accessible as this.props.children</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Children are a special prop that is used by React to denote child elements rendered
							within a component.  They can be accessed using this.props.children, and they can
							be iterated over like an array, but you must use the React.Children API to do that.
							Basically if you nest elements within a JSX tag for a component you create, those
							elements would be rendered using this.props.children.  In my own experience, I haven't
							used this.props.children a lot, but once you get going with react your experience may differ.
							I'd say it more important to plugin authors, or for creating very abstract/reusable components.
							(then show sample on the next slide and explain it)

						<h2>Keys</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The "key" property is used to uniquely identify a child when there are sibling elements</li>
							<li>React uses "key" to differentiate components in a list</li>
							<li>If you are missing "key", you will lose performance, and potentially component updates!</li>
							<li>Typically correspond to a uuid, database id, or loop index as a fallback</li>
							<li>You will be warned in the console if this is missing :)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Keys are a reserved property in JSX that are used internally by react.  They are used
							to differentiate child components among their sibling elements, which is very useful
							for updating lists of items.  If you are missing a key on an item with siblings, you
							will potentially lose performance benefits of React rendering, as well as possible
							updates to a particular item in a list.  It's hard to forget this though, because react
							gives you a warning for each child missing a key prop.  In my experience a key will typically
							be a database row id for items returned from an api, or a uuid that you generate.  It can
							even be a loop index if you have nothing else to fallback on.
